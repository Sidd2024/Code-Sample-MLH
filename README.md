# Code-Sample-MLH

This is a code sample for MLH prep program 2022 from one of web projects called 'ALLOPS'

# Allops Platform

The idea of Allops is to notify people about all the academic activities and opportunities happening around the globe on a single platform.

Developed a dynamic web app to display all the different opportunities according to their respective types. The opportunities are listed with all required information and with a link to the official website. All users can filter the opportunities based on the interest tags.

Users with an account can save opportunities for later, they can turn on mail notifications by selecting the interest tags for which they want to receive mail notifications

Users can also fill a share-form to share opportunities with details so that allops can add them to the list of opportunities
